(defmethod pea-pattern ((lst list))
 "The pea pattern is a variation of the look-and-say sequence that consists to read off the digits of the previous number, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit, and read them in ascending order until the sequence becomes the comment of themself.

For example:
1 is read off as 'one 1' or 11
11 is read off as 'two 1' or 21
21 is read off as 'one 1, one 2' or 1112
1112 is read off as 'three 1, one 2' or 3112

The result is the path leading to the cycle -- if it exists -- and the cycle itself."
